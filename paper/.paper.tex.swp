\begin{abstract}

	The AprilTrack algorithm proposed in this paper seeks to bridge two existing fields of research in computer vision literature: fiducial detection and monocular object tracking. With a rise in the popularity of fiducials, or artificial markers, as a source of ground-truth position data for mobile robots, there has been a considerable interest in designing both robust and blur-resistant fiducials. This paper attempts to improve on existing fiducials such as the AprilTag marker by augmenting fiducial detection algorithms with a particle-filter based monocular object tracker which reliably tracks a fiducial's position and orientation in six degrees of freedom. This novel particle-filter based algorithm is evaluated on several datasets involving both ego-motion and tag-based-motion and is compared to standalone tag detection algorithms.
